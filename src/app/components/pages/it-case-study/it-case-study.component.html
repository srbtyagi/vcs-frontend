                                    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has spurred the growth of telemedicine and other digital
                                        care services, which is anticipated to continue. While the pandemic inspired
                                        incredible demonstrations of cooperation and compassion, evil actors used the
                                        situation for personal gain, as with every disaster. Despite the desperate
                                        effort by hospital employees of setting up field hospitals in parking lots and
                                        clinicians risking their lives to combat the terrifying virus, hackers,
                                        ransomware gangs, and financial con artists redoubled their efforts to steal
                                        sensitive patient information.</p>
                                    <p>According to the Forbes study, the number of reported hacking incidents in
                                        healthcare increased for the fifth year in a row in 2020, increasing 42%. In
                                        2019, hacking events accounted for more than half of all patient data breaches
                                        (62%).</p>

                                    <p>Cybersecurity is a significant concern for healthcare businesses all over the
                                        world. As cyber- attacks and patient data breaches become more widespread,
                                        hospitals and other care facilities need to invest enough in the patients'
                                        privacy security. Cyber-hackers regard the healthcare industry as an easy target
                                        compared to the financial, industrial, and retail sectors.</p>

                                        <p>On May 14, 2021, a ransomware attack hit Ireland's Department of Health and
                                            Health Service Executive (HSE). On the Department of Health's network,
                                            malicious cyber activity was discovered. Several HSE systems were
                                            significantly harmed, and the majority of the company's other systems had to
                                            be shut down, affecting essential health services.</p>

                                        <p>A ransomware attack occurs when a criminal group uses software to access a
                                            system, encrypts essential data, and then demands payment to decrypt it. The
                                            May attack in Ireland was unprecedented in Irish history, hitting nearly
                                            every aspect of the country's healthcare system, which had already been
                                            battered by more than a year of fighting Covid-19.</p>

                                        <p>According to cyberlaw, a criminal gang known as Wizard Spider was identified
                                            as the perpetrators, and they are believed to be based in Saint Petersburg,
                                            Russia. Since a similar digital letter was left on the Department of Health
                                            and the Health Service Executive computers, both events are thought to be
                                            the work of the same cybercrime organization.</p>
                                        <p>A remote access tool known as Cobalt Strike Beacon was discovered on the
                                            affected devices, implying that it was used to move laterally within the
                                            environment before executing the Conti ransomware payload. The assault began
                                            when a single computer failed, prompting the user (an HSE employee) to seek
                                            assistance by clicking on an infected link.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The HSE decided to turn off its IT systems as a precaution to minimize the
                                            attack's impact. For the general public and the HSE, this has had
                                            far-reaching consequences. Services that rely on computerized processes,
                                            such as scans, referrals, and diagnostic services, had to be operated
                                            manually, which caused delays. The cyberattack brought cyber security risks
                                            to the attention of Irish businesses, the media, and the general public.</p>
                                        <p>The assailants were most likely pursuing monetary gain because they demanded
                                            the HSE for $20 million (Â£14 million) to restore services following the
                                            incident. However, the Irish government stated that it did not and would not
                                            compensate the hackers. The incident impacted several Irish hospitals. It
                                            forced the cancellation of many outpatient clinics and healthcare services
                                            since the HSE's national and local networks were nearly completely shut
                                            down.</p>
                                        <p>While the HSE hack targeted a large organization, cyber risk affects all
                                            healthcare organizations, regardless of size or brand. Healthcare
                                            organizations must guarantee that cybersecurity is prioritized as a
                                            board-level problem, as it is in most other industries.</p>
                                        <p>The Irish cyberattack served as a reminder of the cyber threat that
                                            healthcare organizations face today. The strike was the most severe attack
                                            on essential infrastructure in Irish history, causing treatment delays and
                                            non-emergency procedures to be canceled. Similar events have been recorded
                                            across Europe, where the failure to protect health systems and data has put
                                            patients' data under security threat.</p>

                                        <p>The lack of cyber security has already been demonstrated to be one of the
                                            leading causes of healthcare service disruptions, but the need for cyber
                                            security extends far beyond that. As health services become more reliant on
                                            information technology, attackers' interest in health organizations and data
                                            develops. Terrorists, fraudsters, and other attackers can abuse data
                                            privacy, the availability of health services, or even the lives of patients.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>HSE CEO Paul Reid termed the incident as "quite a sophisticated." He warned
                                            that the hospital information technology systems and the healthcare data
                                            stored on central servers are constantly being targeted.</p>

                                        <p>In conclusion, health care institutions remain the most vulnerable and on
                                            target by cyberattackers. Healthcare database systems are known to hold so
                                            much information of significant monetary and intelligence value to
                                            cybercriminals. Primary healthcare providers, specialists, community and
                                            aged care providers, diagnostic service providers, government health
                                            departments, research and academic organizations, and healthcare
                                            consultancies are vulnerable to cybercrimes in the healthcare sector.</p>

                                        <div class="dez-post-text">
                                            <p>Coca-Cola Amatil is the largest bottler and distributor of non-alcoholic
                                                bottled beverages in the Asia Pacific and one of the regionâs largest
                                                bottlers of Coca-Cola products. Since its inception in 1904, the
                                                companies had made numerous strides in market penetration in the Asia
                                                Pacific market before being replaced by Euro pacific partners to handle
                                                products in the same line .</p>

                                            <p>Despite its meteoric growth, the company greatly struggled in its retail
                                                inventory control as it didnât pose any formidable criteria for
                                                automated store management systems. Most of its inventory control was
                                                limited to manual measurements of products which were slow and sluggish
                                                due to delays in analogy data processing of phone conversation .
                                                Evidently, Coca-Cola Amatil also relied heavily on the productivity and
                                                ability of their extensive network of sales representatives to
                                                distribute and sell products. With a great need for sales automation,
                                                Coca-Cola Amatil sale representatives proposed using Trax Retail
                                                Execution image; an automated image recognition technology platform that
                                                uses computer vision solutions to analyse analogue signals. Trax
                                                technology enabled Coca-Cola Amatil store keepers to take pictures of
                                                store shelves with their mobile devices and send the images to the Trax
                                                Cloud . The images are then analysed and returned with actionable
                                                reports within minutes to sales reps and provide more detailed online
                                                management assessments. This way, Trax supported Coca-Colaâs lifeline,
                                                the sales representatives and call centre agents across the Asia-Pacific
                                                region by providing market ,store and supply chain situations .By
                                                utilizing Trax technology that allows them to get detailed reports and
                                                analyse current and future trends and issues ,Coca-Cola Amatilâs
                                                front-line teams become more productive and were able to improve the
                                                companyâs revenue. Real-time images of stock allowed sales reps to
                                                quickly identify performance gaps and apply corrective actions in store.
                                                Reports on shelf share and competitive insights also allowed reps to
                                                strategize on opportunities in store and over the phone with store
                                                managers. This led to Coca-Cola Amatil gaining 1.3% market share in the
                                                Asia Pacific region within five months.</p>

                                            <p>Trax was essential in ensuring that Coca-Cola Amatil transitioned from
                                                ineffective traditional manual verification systems into more effective
                                                ones. Traditional manual verification systems were rendered outdated as
                                                they were costly and timely, and resulted in a decrease in productivity
                                                and sales as representatives spent a lot of time auditing rather than
                                                marketing and selling products. Overall, in the fast-paced world, this
                                                had a negative impact on the companyâs market share price. On the
                                                contrary, a new combination of digitization (image procession by
                                                computer vision) and data analytics (image processing to make
                                                intelligent recommendations) proved great.</p>
