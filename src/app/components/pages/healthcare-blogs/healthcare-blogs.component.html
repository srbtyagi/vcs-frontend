                    The rising nursing to patient ratio is one of the most
                    discussed topics in a modern-day clinical setting. Nurses
                    are asked to care for more patients with individual
                    healthcare centers and states being left to handle this
                    ever-increasing problem. Research shows that a balanced
                    nurse-to-patient ratio leads to increased patient
                    satisfaction and better quality of care. Furthermore, a
                    balanced ratio means reduced readmission cases and patients
                    recovering at a fast rate because of receiving care from an
                    adequately staffed nursing team (Shin et al., 2018).
                    However, the situation on the ground is different, with
                    nurses being forced to take care of a higher number of
                    patients than the required one: two.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cost of hiring healthcare professionals takes a huge
                    chunk of the money hospitals make, necessitating keeping the
                    numbers low to avoid spending huge amounts on salaries. As a
                    result, it becomes challenging to maintain the low patient
                    ratio. Equally, high turnover rates among healthcare
                    professionals also affect the ratio negatively.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Healthcare centers have a huge role in dealing with the
                    nurse: patient ratio by ensuring that they hire enough
                    nurses such that healthcare teams handling a patient are not
                    affected in case of a no show or no call by one of the
                    members can be replaced easily. Additionally, nurses should
                    be trained on the demands of the profession to avoid high
                    turnover rates (Wynendaele et al., 2019). To sum up,
                    positive working relationships among healthcare teams should
                    be encouraged by involving nurses in hospital
                    decision-making and continuous training.

                  <h5>
                    Travel Nurse versus Staff Nurse: What’s the Difference?
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    Travel nursing is not the same a staff nursing. Here are
                    some of the major differences.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Work responsibilities</h5>
                  <p>
                    A travel nurse is expected to step into an unfamiliar unit
                    in an unfamiliar facility and pick up a full assignment on
                    the first shift, often with minimal orientation. In
                    contrast, a staff nurse will often have several months of
                    orientation before they are expected to handle the same
                    assignment. However, travelers are often given a pass on
                    some of the documentation expectations, particularly on the
                    more esoteric pieces of the chart. And travelers will rarely
                    be assigned to care for the sickest or most complex patients
                    within a unit.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Staff and management attitude</h5>
                  <p>
                    Travelers are expected to be competent, confident, and able
                    to quickly pick up their assignment without needing any sort
                    of hand-holding. Management expects strong work performance
                    and high quality nursing skills. Staff expects the traveler
                    to ask questions where needed, to remember what they have
                    been told, to work well in a team, and to work without
                    complaining or comparing the current facility to other
                    places where the traveler may have worked. In most
                    instances, the traveler will not be assigned to the sickest
                    patients within a unit and will frequently be given a
                    lighter assignment for the first few shifts until they have
                    figured out how things work on this unit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Because travelers will usually only be around for thirteen
                    weeks, there is a tendency to avoid addressing smaller
                    issues because the irritation will soon be gone. Staff
                    nurses, since they are expected to be around for a long(er)
                    time, are often held to higher standards. Experiences vary
                    widely, and part of the challenge of travel nursing is that
                    you do not know which you will get until you begin to work
                    at the next assignment.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Workload</h5>
                  <p>
                    Workload varies widely. However, travelers are usually
                    expected to carry a full assignment. Depending on the
                    culture of the unit, they may also be given the heaviest or
                    least wanted assignments. Experiences vary widely. Some
                    assignments will be great, others will be horrible.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Why travel nursing is still a positive experience</h5>
                  <p>
                    Travel nursing takes you to places and into situations that
                    you would otherwise never get to experience. Where else
                    would you get to travel, with paid accommodations, and work
                    in multiple facilities all across your state (or multiple
                    states, depending on your licensure and the policies of the
                    agency you are working for)? You will be stretched, you will
                    rapidly improve your skills, you will love it and you will
                    hate it. You may discover a job so wonderful that you decide
                    to transition to a staff nurse there. You will certainly
                    learn a lot about yourself and about human nature. You will
                    meet wonderful people and horrible people and everything
                    in-between.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Travel nursing requires a relatively high level of skill and
                    experience going into it. Confidence and humility and good
                    teamwork certainly don’t hurt. If you have those things,
                    travel nursing can be a wonderful experience.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Demand of Travel Nursing after Covid19.</h5>
                  <p>
                    Travel nursing. It sounds cool and all, but what is it? Can
                    I make money doing it? Is it steady work? This short article
                    intends to answer some of the most common questions about
                    travel nursing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Travel nurses (aka travelers) provide temporary fill-in
                    assistance, usually when a hospital or other facility is
                    short-staffed, either due to losing large numbers of their
                    staff or because of an unusual surge in demand/patient load.
                    Travelers usually work a thirteen-week contract in one
                    location, then move on to the next.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With the current pandemic, there has been an unprecedented
                    demand for travel nursing, especially for those who are
                    willing to serve COVID-positive patients in situations with
                    limited resources. With the heightened demand, pay rates
                    have risen commensurately. Anecdotally, $125 per hour is not
                    unusual for nurses working in intensive care units in the
                    middle of an outbreak.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So. What does this mean for the intrepid travel nurse? Will
                    there still be demand after COVID?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Absolutely yes. Travel nursing has been around for a long
                    time, and it isn’t going away anytime soon.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If you have the experience to begin now, it’s a great time
                    to get into it, since the rates are higher than they’ve ever
                    been. However, even if you are just graduating and still
                    need several years of critical care experience before you
                    sign your first contract, the demand is pretty certain to
                    stay strong until then. The current high rates are unlikely
                    to stay, but travelers have always been able to command a
                    premium for their ability to step into any unit and start
                    working with only minimal orientation. If that sounds like
                    you, go for it!

                    Being a nurse in a global pandemic is a unique and
                    challenging calling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are like most healthcare professionals, you became a
                    nurse to save lives and to help others. Depending on where
                    you work, both of those desires have been deeply challenged
                    over the last year. Ethical dilemmas abound, and so do
                    Casualties and disability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Long hours and tiring work have always been a part of
                    nursing, but that has become ever so much more so during the
                    ongoing pandemic. Mandatory quarantines, parents staying
                    home with children who are doing school online, and higher
                    patient loads in acute care, rehab, and long term care lead
                    to chronic short-staffing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Risk of life has increased everywhere, but especially felt
                    by those caring for known COVID-positive patients. Add to
                    that the stress of perhaps carrying COVID to a family
                    member, and nurses are bearing a load of anxiety such as
                    hasn’t been known in decades.

                    I became a nurse to save lives and help others. You, too,
                    probably.

                    Together, let’s take a deep breath and remember that this
                    hasn’t changed. Get a good night’s sleep, strap on your N95,
                    wash your hands, smile with your eyes, and go bring your
                    unique blend of caring and skill into a world that
                    desperately needs it.

                    Healthcare workers have been serving Community and providing
                    care to the patients in need. We know healthcare Workers
                    sometime cancel personal plans and miss family functions
                    when Hospital/Facility is short in staffing and need workers
                    to worker so VCS is thankful to the Healthcare workers for
                    provider services!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    VCS is happy to work with healthcare service providers and
                    healthcare workers to maintain the Supply and Demand ratio
                    so patients always get the care and attention as needed.
