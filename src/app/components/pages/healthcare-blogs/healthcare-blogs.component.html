                Adoption of healthcare technology is complex, and it takes time
                to design and implement. Because healthcare organizations have
                not kept up with new trends and dangers, they are susceptible.
                Many healthcare systems have been forced to embrace digitization
                across all department levels. Adopting new technologies and new
                ways of working to satisfy demand has led to hospitals
                overlooking cyber security, thereby becoming vulnerable to cyber
                threats.

                Healthcare cyber security is becoming increasingly significant.
                Hacking and IT security attacks have progressively increased
                over the years, and many healthcare organizations have battled
                to defend their network perimeter and keep cybercriminals at
                bay. Here are the ways to improve cyber security in healthcare
                systems:

              </h3>
              <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                Security awareness training should be given to everyone involved
                in the healthcare system, including doctors, staff, volunteers,
                and vendors. Using real-life hacking and phishing instances is
                the best technique. Some companies intentionally phish their
                team as a form of training. Employees need to be taught the
                procedure for reporting suspicious behavior for quick response.

              <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                Software developers offer updates for their programs and apps
                frequently for better performance and as a security measure.
                Such updates are essential because they safe computers from
                opportunistic cyber threats. Most of the successful system hacks
                result from exploiting known security flaws of an outdated
                program or app. Many hackers will look through freshly published
                lists of system vulnerabilities and then look for opportunities
                to exploit to access servers.

                Use of Firewall

              <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                The usage of firewalls can considerably lessen the impact of
                cyber-attacks on healthcare. A firewall can be installed at
                various places throughout your network to safeguard assets on
                both sides by screening traffic and deleting data packets that
                contain risks. Remote employees can utilize firewalls to set up
                secure, encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs).

                Strong passwords are a great way to stay safe in an online
                world. A strong password is made up of long strings of letters,
                numbers, and characters and does not have any terms that can be
                found in a dictionary. Never use a set of numbers and letters
                that can be predicted, and do not repeat the same password for
                another account. In a multi-authentication system, a password
                should be the only step to ease a password shared or stolen by
                the incorrect person. Using a secondary form of identification,
                such as biometric data or a physical device that creates a
                temporary passcode, will improve your security.

                Driving Digital Transformation with Data science as a Service
              </h3>
              <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                In a fast-paced technological world, technological
                interoperability has become inevitable as an organization aims
                to leverage every technological development for business gain.
                In every tenant of business, digitization helps accelerate
                business processes, leverage new opportunities, and solidify the
                organizationâ€™s position in a competitive business environment.
                However, digitization alone cannot provide adequate information
                from millions of data streams generated by modern-day industrial
                operations. Companies aim to unlock the power of their digitally
                generated data by exploiting power in analytical science, hence
                putting data science as a prime mover in the digital
                transformation process.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                The increasing deluge of data leads to the need of digitizing
                critical business processes, which gives data science a role in
                harnessing data to generate insights and add value to the
                organization. Data science-oriented constituents such as Big
                Data and Analytics increase business intelligence and improve
                decisions made by the organization, identify new opportunities
                and targets, enable informed decision making, among other (see
                Image 1).However, having the correct data at the right time will
                be essential in facilitating smart planning especially through
                enabling the interoperability between data science and digital
                process to drive digital transformation by process
                optimizations. As consumer emotions increasingly become
                necessary, data science plays a critical role in knowing how
                consumers feel or connect - an essential factor in gaining
                consumer trust. More also, machine learning has proved to be a
                game-changer in the digital transformation process. What is
                interesting is that machine learning exceptionally relies on
                data science. Hence data science has become a backbone to the
                digital transformation of the modern world.

                technologies and data requires developing an effective data
                science strategy. Data science as a service presents enormous
                opportunities by enabling businesses to efficiently leverage
                data science to make better decisions, operate more efficiently
                and profitably, offer more personalized experiences, and improve
                the overall quality of services. Now businesses do not have to
                depend on guesswork anymore since data science can help make
                more concrete predictions when human intuition and experience
                fail. The key to seizing these opportunities lies in our ability
                to seamlessly introduce data science into the digital
                transformation processes within a company.
