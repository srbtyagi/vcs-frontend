                                        dangers, they are susceptible. Many healthcare systems have been forced to
                                        embrace digitization across all department levels. Adopting new technologies and
                                        new ways of working to satisfy demand has led to hospitals overlooking cyber

                                    <p>Healthcare cyber security is becoming increasingly significant. Hacking and IT

                                    <p>Strong passwords are a great way to stay safe in an online world. A strong
                                        password is made up of long strings of letters, numbers, and characters and does
                                        not have any terms that can be found in a dictionary. Never use a set of numbers
                                        and letters that can be predicted, and do not repeat the same password for
                                        another account. In a multi-authentication system, a password should be the only
                                        step to ease a password shared or stolen by the incorrect person. Using a

                                    <p>In a fast-paced technological world, technological interoperability has become
                                        inevitable as an organization aims to leverage every technological development
                                        for business gain. In every tenant of business, digitization helps accelerate
                                        business processes, leverage new opportunities, and solidify the organizationâ€™s
                                        position in a competitive business environment. However, digitization alone
                                        cannot provide adequate information from millions of data streams generated by
                                        modern-day industrial operations. Companies aim to unlock the power of their
                                        digitally generated data by exploiting power in analytical science, hence
                                        putting data science as a prime mover in the digital transformation process.</p>
                                    <p>The increasing deluge of data leads to the need of digitizing critical business
                                        processes, which gives data science a role in harnessing data to generate
                                        insights and add value to the organization. Data science-oriented constituents
                                        such as Big Data and Analytics increase business intelligence and improve
                                        decisions made by the organization, identify new opportunities and targets,
                                        enable informed decision making, among other (see Image 1).However, having the
                                        correct data at the right time will be essential in facilitating smart planning
                                        especially through enabling the interoperability between data science and
                                        digital process to drive digital transformation by process optimizations. As
                                        consumer emotions increasingly become necessary, data science plays a critical
                                        role in knowing how consumers feel or connect - an essential factor in gaining
                                        consumer trust. More also, machine learning has proved to be a game-changer in
                                        the digital transformation process. What is interesting is that machine learning
                                        exceptionally relies on data science. Hence data science has become a backbone
                                        to the digital transformation of the modern world.</p>

                                        profitably, offer more personalized experiences, and improve the overall quality
                                        of services. Now businesses do not have to depend on guesswork anymore since
                                        data science can help make more concrete predictions when human intuition and
                                        experience fail. The key to seizing these opportunities lies in our ability to
                                        seamlessly introduce data science into the digital transformation processes
                                        within a company.</p>
